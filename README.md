# Kattis-Solutions

Welcome to my repository of C++ solutions for Kattis problems!

## About

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from the Kattis platform, implemented in C++. These solutions are intended to serve as educational resources for understanding problem-solving approaches and algorithms.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in this repository. Each solution is accompanied by problem descriptions and explanations, helping you understand the problem-solving process. While these solutions can be used as references, it's important to approach them with the intention of learning and understanding the underlying concepts rather than using them to cheat on assignments or competitions.
